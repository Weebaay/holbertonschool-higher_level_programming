# Python - Hello, World

	Welcome to the Python - Hello, 
	World project! This repository is dedicated to introducing you to the basics of Python programming,
	including using the Python interpreter, printing text, working with strings
	and understanding Python's coding style.

## Author's Disclaimer

	Welcome to the Python world! You'll quickly find that there are many ways to solve the same problem in Python, and that’s part 
	of its flexibility and power. Some tasks might expect a specific implementation, while others offer multiple possible solutions.

	At Holberton, we won’t start with strict PyCode (PEP8) enforcement, as it is stricter than necessary at this stage.
	You can safely ignore minor warnings when running pycodestyle, but it is good practice to write clean, readable code
	following Python’s conventions.

## Resources

	Here are some helpful resources to get started with Python:

    	* Learn to Program (YouTube Playlist)
    	* Whetting Your Appetite (Python Docs)
    	* Using the Python Interpreter (Python Docs)
    	* An Informal Introduction to Python (Python Docs) (read up to section 3.1.2)
    	* How To Use String Formatters in Python 3 (Digital Ocean)
    	* Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code

## Requirements
### Python Scripts

    Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs
    All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
    All files should end with a new line
    The first line of all Python scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    The repository should include a README.md file at the root, describing the project
    Code should be formatted according to the pycodestyle style guide (version 2.7.*)
    All Python scripts must be executable
    The length of each file will be tested using wc

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
	python-hello_world/
	├── README.md        # Project description
	├── 0-run            # Bash script to run a Python file
	├── 1-print.py       # Python script that prints a string
	├── 2-print.py       # Python script to print "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"
	├── 3-print_number.py# Python script to print an integer with a message
	├── 4-print_float.py # Python script to print a float with precision
	├── 5-print_string.py# Python script to manipulate and print strings
	├── 6-concat.py      # Python script to concatenate strings
	├── 7-edges.py       # Python script to work with string slices
	├── 8-concat_edges.py# Python script to create a specific sentence
	└── 9-easter_egg.py  # Python script to print "The Zen of Python"

### How to Use

To run the scripts:

1. Clone the repository:
	https://github.com/Weebaay/holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
	cd python-hello_world

3. Ensure the scripts are executable:
	chmod +x <script_name>.py

4. Run the script:
	./<script_name>.py

Example:
./2-print.py

Voici une version mise à jour du README.md avec une section abrégée pour les tâches et une nouvelle section pour la structure du projet :
Python - Hello, World

Welcome to the Python - Hello, World project! This project is designed to introduce you to the basics of Python programming. You'll learn how to use the Python interpreter, manipulate strings, and follow the official Python style guide (PEP8).

Welcome to the Python world!

You'll soon find that with Python (and most higher-level languages), there are many ways to solve the same problem. Some tasks may require a specific solution, while others may allow for multiple possible implementations.

Python has a linter/style guide called PEP8, also known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won’t start with PyCode since it is stricter compared to PEP8. Don’t worry if you see warnings when running PEP8, you can safely ignore them.

Enjoy!
