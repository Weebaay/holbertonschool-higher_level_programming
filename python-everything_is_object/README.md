# Python - Everything is Object

## Description

This project dives into Python's object model and its unique handling of variables, references, mutable and immutable types. The aim is to develop a deeper understanding of Python's object behavior to write efficient and bug-free code. 

Key questions addressed in this project include:
- How does Python manage object references?
- What are mutable and immutable types, and why do they matter?
- How does variable aliasing affect program behavior?
- What happens when variables are passed to functions?

By working through these exercises, you will build a solid foundation in Python's object management.

## Background Context

In Python:
- **Everything is an object**, whether it's a primitive type like `int` or complex data structures like lists.
- Mutable and immutable objects behave differently when assigned, passed, or modified.

### Example: Mutable vs Immutable
```python
# Immutable type example (int)
a = 1
b = a
a = 2
print(b)  # Output: 1

# Mutable type example (list)
l = [1, 2, 3]
m = l
l[0] = 'x'
print(m)  # Output: ['x', 2, 3]
```

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Define what an object is.
- Differentiate between a class, an object, and an instance.
- Explain mutable vs immutable objects.
- Understand references, assignments, and aliases.
- Identify whether two variables point to the same object.
- Retrieve a variable's identifier (memory address).
- List Python's built-in mutable and immutable types.
- Describe how Python passes variables to functions and the implications for different types.

# Requirements

## Python Scripts

- Files must be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- The first line of every file should be:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3

- Use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*) coding standard.
- All scripts should be executable and end with a new line.

.txt **Answer Files**

- Answers must be single-line entries.
- No shebang (#!/usr/bin/python3) in answer files.
- All files should end with a new line.
