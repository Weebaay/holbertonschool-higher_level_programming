# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description

This project is part of the Python learning curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on working with lists and tuples in Python, which are essential data structures used in many Python applications. By the end of this project, students will understand the differences between lists and tuples, how to use them, and their related operations.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- Python scripts are formatted with `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*).
- All code files end with a new line.
- Executable permissions must be set on all Python scripts.
- The first line of each Python script must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

## Files and Tasks

The project is structured with multiple Python scripts that focus on lists and tuples.

| 4      | `4-new_in_list.py`            | A function that replaces an element in a list without modifying the original list.                  |
| 5      | `5-no_c.py`                   | A function that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.                                   |
| 6      | `6-print_matrix_integer.py`   | A function that prints a matrix of integers.                                                        |
| 7      | `7-add_tuple.py`              | A function that adds two tuples and returns the result.                                             |
| 8      | `8-multiple_returns.py`       | A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.                |
| 9      | `9-max_integer.py`            | A function that finds the largest integer in a list.                                                |
| 10     | `10-divisible_by_2.py`        | A function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.                                                 |
| 11     | `11-delete_at.py`             | A function that deletes an item at a specific position in a list.                                   |
