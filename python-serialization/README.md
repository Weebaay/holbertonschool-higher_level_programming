# Python - Serialization

## Description

This project focuses on the core concepts of serialization and marshaling, which are essential in computer science for efficient data storage and transmission. By completing this project, you'll develop practical skills in handling data formats like JSON, CSV, and XML, while also learning about Python-specific serialization techniques using modules like pickle.

## Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Familiarity with basic Python syntax (functions, classes, file I/O)
    Knowledge of data structures such as dictionaries and lists
    Modules: json, csv, pickle, xml.etree.ElementTree
