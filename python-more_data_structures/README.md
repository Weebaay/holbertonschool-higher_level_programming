# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
## Description

	This project is part of the Python curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on more advanced data structures in Python, such as sets and dictionaries. Additionally, you will learn about the utility of lambda functions and the map, filter, and reduce functions.

	By the end of this project, you should be able to understand and manipulate sets and dictionaries, as well as use higher-order functions to operate on sequences of data.
## Requirements

    .All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
    .Python scripts are formatted with pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
    .All files should end with a new line.
    .Executable permissions must be set on all Python scripts.
    .The first line of each Python script must be #!/usr/bin/python3.

## Example
### Example usage for Task 0:
	square_matrix_simple([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
 	Output:
 	[[1, 4, 9], [16, 25, 36], [49, 64, 81]]
