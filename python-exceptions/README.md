# Python - Exceptions
## Description

	This project is part of the Python curriculum at Holberton School, focusing on exception handling in Python. It introduces the concepts of errors and exceptions, and teaches how to handle these situations using Python's built-in features. By the end of this project, students will have a solid understanding of how to work with exceptions and apply best practices for error handling in Python.
## Requirements

	. All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
	. Python scripts must be formatted with pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
	. All code files must end with a new line.
	. Executable permissions must be set on all Python scripts.
	. The first line of each Python script must be #!/usr/bin/python3

## Files and Tasks

| Task # | Filename                   | Description                                                                                         |
|--------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | `0-safe_print_list.py`      | A function that prints x elements of a list using try/except for error handling.                    |
| 1      | `1-safe_print_integer.py`   | A function that safely prints an integer using try/except.                                          |
| 2      | `2-safe_print_list_integers.py` | A function that prints the first x elements of a list, but only prints integers.                  |
| 3      | `3-safe_print_division.py`  | A function that divides two integers and prints the result. Handles division errors.                 |
| 4      | `4-list_division.py`        | A function that divides element by element two lists, handling errors like division by zero.        |
| 5      | `5-raise_exception.py`      | A function that raises a type exception.                                                            |
| 6      | `6-raise_exception_msg.py`  | A function that raises a name exception with a custom message.                                      |

## Example

**Example usage for Task 0:**
	safe_print_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)
	# Output:
	# 12
	# nb_print: 2

## Usage

**To execute any of the tasks, simply run the script as shown in the examples below**:
	$ ./0-safe_print_list.py
