    Class that defines a square.

    This is an empty class that serves as the foundation for future developments,
    where functionality such as size management, area calculation, and other square-related
    operations will be added in subsequent exercises.

    Attributes:
        None at the moment, since this class only defines the basic structure.

    Methods:
        None yet. Future methods will provide functionality for this class.
